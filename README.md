RGA Embedding Project

---
## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the implementation of RGA Embedding, a system designed for efficient retrieval, generation, and analysis using embeddings.
It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, vector embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines to process documents and enable interactive Q&A.

The Jupyter Notebook (RGA_Embeddeding.ipynb) walks through:

Data preprocessing

Embedding generation

RAG pipeline setup

PDF creation from results

Interactive question answering

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/arvindashok2305/RAG_embedding-finetune
cd fruits-veg-classification


Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

---
## 🚀 Usage
Running the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


Open RGA_Embeddeding.ipynb and run cells sequentially.

Using as Python Modules

Configure settings in config.py.

Run the RAG pipeline:

python rag_pipeline.py


Use interactive Q&A:

python interactive_qa.py

## 📂 Features

Embedding Generation – Creates vector embeddings from input text.

RAG Pipeline – Integrates embeddings into a retrieval-augmented generation workflow.

Interactive Q&A – Enables real-time question answering.

PDF Export – Saves query responses and results as formatted PDFs.

Modular Codebase – Organized into separate modules for maintainability.

---
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

LangChain / Hugging Face Transformers (if used)

FAISS / Chroma (for vector storage and retrieval)

ReportLab (for PDF generation)

Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt

---
## 📖 Example Workflow

Load dataset and preprocess text.

Generate embeddings using pre-trained models.

Store embeddings in a vector database.

Query the database with natural language questions.

Retrieve relevant context and generate responses.

Export results to a PDF file.

---
## 📌 Notes

Make sure to add your API keys in config.py before running.

You can expand the RAG pipeline inside rag_pipeline.py with embeddings, vector databases, and LLMs.
